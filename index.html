        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>

            <li>The head element contains information (or metadata) that helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>

            <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>

            <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Cascading Style Sheets is a programming langauge used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>External CSS style sheets allows for developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier.</li>
