# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created so that boot camp students going through the Prework may have a place to look at important notes and study. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. While making this Study Guide, I learned a lot about the processes of creating a website!
